## Description

### Background

carSHAiR is a peer to peer car sharing platform with a mission to bring high tech solutions to provide an exceptional experience for Guests and Hosts within the car sharing space.

Often times, product requirements are manifested as a series of UI sketches. These sketches provide context as to the user experience our product team envisions for users of the platform.

In order for a car to be "rentable", a car must first be "listed" on the platform. A common user workflow for our Hosts (owners of cars) is to list a new car on the platform. This workflow takes Hosts through a multi-step process in which details about the car are collected, building towards a final listing of their car.

One simplified step in this multi-step process of listing a car is to collect essential details about the Host's car.

## Assumptions made:
Data model: I assumed that we have 3 data models namely base-model, car-details, vehicle-identification-number.
Services: I assumed that we have 2 services namely car-details and vehicle-identification-number.
Created a REST API which has 2 get requests and 3 post requests.
## Steps to bring up the server:
 i) Clone the repository
ii) Bring the docker-composer up
iii) yarn install 
iv) yarn dev
v) send postman request
vi) Push the code to GIT if any modifications made and repeat step iv, v.
