## Description

### Background

carSHAiR is a peer to peer car sharing platform with a mission to bring high tech solutions to provide an exceptional experience for Guests and Hosts within the car sharing space.

Often times, product requirements are manifested as a series of UI sketches. These sketches provide context as to the user experience our product team envisions for users of the platform.

In order for a car to be "rentable", a car must first be "listed" on the platform. A common user workflow for our Hosts (owners of cars) is to list a new car on the platform. This workflow takes Hosts through a multi-step process in which details about the car are collected, building towards a final listing of their car.

One simplified step in this multi-step process of listing a car is to collect essential details about the Host's car.
